# DEPRECATED: use juancampa/dotfiles instead


vimrc
=====

My vimrc. So I can keep them in sync. This vimrc work on windows and needs to be adapted for *nix.

Important
=====

Remember to create these two folders to enable persistent undo and a single place for swapfiles.

 * ~/vimfiles/undodir
 * ~/vimfiles/swapfiles

Also remember to install NeoBundle
